  This is a simple project which is designed to allow you to conduct
 operations upon the messages maintained on a remote IMAP server.

  So far this code has only been tested against the Googlamil service,
 but I'd anticipate it should work regardless of IMAP server.

   Usage is non-documented at the moment, except for this short
 configuration example:

siftrc:
--

username: somebody.says
password: testing

folder:cm status:new subject:blackvelvet mark:read exec:"notify"
--



Operations
----------

  All operations have a notion of the working set.  By default when
 a folder is opened each message is included in that working set.

  The set may be reduced by filtering on status, subject, or body-content.

  For example the following selects all messages:

folder:foo

  This selects all new messages in the folder:

folder:foo status:new


  Filters are chained, so this next example selects all messages containing
 "foo" in the subject which are new:

folder:foo status:new subject:foo



Primitives
----------


   subject: foo
     Reduce the working set to those messages which contain 'foo' in the
    subject.

   from:bar@bar.com
     Reduce the working set to those messags which contain 'bar@bar.com'
    in the sender adress

   status:[new|read]
     Select only messags with the given state.


    delete
     Delete all currently selected messages.

    move:bar
     Move all currently selected messages into the new folder 'bar'.

    mark:[read|unread]
     Mark all selected messages as either read/unread.
