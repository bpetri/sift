  sift is a simple utility which is designed to allow you to conduct
 operations upon the messages located upon a remote IMAP server.



Sample Usage
------------

  To get started you'll need to write a rule or two, then pass that
 file as an argument to sift.

  Here is one of the simplest possible rulefiles:

/--------------------------------
server:   imap.gmail.com
username: somebody.says
password: testing

folder:inbox status:new mark:read
\--------------------------------------


  This marks all new messages in the "inbox" as being read.



How Sift Works
--------------

  Each sift rule is considered as part of a chain.  By default when you
 select a folder to open *all* messages are selected.

  Rules in the chain have two purposes:

   1.  Refine the list of selected messages.

   2.  Perform an operation upon the currently selected messages.


  For example this will select all messages:

"folder:inbox"

  This will delete all messages:

"folder:inbox delete"

  Why does that work?  Because the act of opening a folder selects all
 messages, and the "delete" operation deletes all currently selected
 messages.

  To refine thing you may reduce the messages selected by filtering on
 different fields.  For example:

"folder:inbox subject:foo delete"

  This will reduce the selection of all messages to all message containing
 the word "foo" in their title - then delete just those.



Primitives
----------

  As explained there are two types of primitives, or rules, available.
 Those that change the selected messages on some criteria, and those that
 operate upon the list of selected messages.  These are known as either
 "selection" or "operation" rules.


Selection Rules:

   folder:foo
     Select the specified folder.  To ease use with Googlemail all '#'
    characters are converted to spaces.  This allows the following rule
    to work as expected:  "folder:[Google#Mail]/Spam delete"

   subject:foo
     Reduce the working set to those messages which contain 'foo' in the
    subject.

   !subject:foo
     Reduce the working set to those messages which do not contain 'foo'
    in the subject.

   from:bar@bar.com
     Reduce the working set to those messags which contain 'bar@bar.com'
    in the sender adress

   !from:bar@bar.com
     Reduce the working set to those messags which do not contain
    'bar@bar.com' in the sender adress

   status:[new|old]
     Select only messags with the given state.  "new" means unread, and
    "old" means messages that have been read.


Operation Rules:

    copy:bar
     Copy all currently selected messages into the folder 'bar'.

    delete
     Delete all currently selected messages.

    move:bar
     Move all currently selected messages into the new folder 'bar'.

    mark:[read|unread]
     Mark all selected messages as either read/unread.

    exec:/usr/local/bin/foo
     Run the program "/usr/local/bin/foo" with the body of each selected
    message passed as STDIN.  This program is executed once for each
    selected message.

    execonce:/usr/local/bin/foo
     Run the program "/usr/local/bin/foo".  This runs the program only
    once regardless of the number of selected messages.

    dump
     Provide a brief list of the selected messages, their sender, recipient,
    and subject.
